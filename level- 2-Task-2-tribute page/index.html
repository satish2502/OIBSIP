          <hr>

            <li>Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, on 28 December 1937,and is the son of Naval Tata (born in
              Surat). His biological maternal grandmother had been the sister of Hirabai Tata, wife of group founder
              Jamshedji Tata. His biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, had belonged to the broader Tata family; Ratan
              therefore was a Tata by birth. Parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when Ratan was 10, and he was
              subsequently raised by the widow of Sir Ratanji Tata, his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who formally adopted
              him through the J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage. He has a half-brother, Noel Tata (from Naval Tata's second
              marriage with Simone Tata), with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati.
